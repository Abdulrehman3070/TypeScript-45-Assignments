// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names:string[]=["Ahmed","Ali","Danish","Saqib","Shahid"]

console.log("Hello",names[0],"You have a good hand writing");
console.log("Hello",names[1],"You have a good hand writing");
console.log("Hello",names[2],"You have a good hand writing");
console.log("Hello",names[3],"You have a good hand writing");
console.log("Hello",names[4],"You have a good hand writing");
