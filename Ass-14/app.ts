//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// Store guest names in an array
let guests: string[] = ["Amir", "Saqib", "Danish"];

// Print an invitation message for each guest
console.log(`Dear ${guests[0]}, I would like to invite you to dinner. It would be an honor to have you as my guest.`);
console.log(`Dear ${guests[1]}, I would like to invite you to dinner. It would be an honor to have you as my guest.`);
console.log(`Dear ${guests[2]}, I would like to invite you to dinner. It would be an honor to have you as my guest.`);
